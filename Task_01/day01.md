## My Reflection on AI-Driven Development (AIDD) 

For me, AI-Driven Development (AIDD) means creating software with the help of AI, so developers no longer have to write every single line of code or design all the logic themselves. AI is not just a small helper; it is now the main executor. jaisay hum abhi GEMINI CLI ko use kr rhy hain or hum kya kr rhy we simply provide prompts and then all the components and code are generated plus executed by GEMINI CLI. or mujy lgta yeh hume zyada focus krne ka time dy rhi on creative and strategic solutions plus this approach makes the development process much easier.


## How do you see the future of Human–AI Collaboration in software development?

In my opinion, in the future AI will not replace developers in software development. It will only help them, like a partner. When a human is working on an idea, AI can generate code, fix errors, and handle repetitive tasks, while the human focuses on strategic decisions. This will make software development faster, easier, and more efficient. In short, AI and humans will work together as a strong team in software development.
